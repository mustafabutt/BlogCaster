# PROJECT CONTEXT — Social Media Agent

## Overview
A CLI-based agent that fetches blog posts from Hugo-based blog platforms via RSS feeds, formats them into professional social media posts using an LLM, and publishes them to LinkedIn and X (Twitter). The agent is platform-driven — each blog platform is registered in a JSON registry and the agent can operate independently per platform.

## Two Operating Modes
- **Manual Mode**: User provides a specific blog post URL. Agent auto-detects the platform, fetches content, formats, posts, and records.
- **Auto Mode**: User provides a platform ID. Agent fetches the RSS feed, picks the latest unpublished post, formats, posts, and records.

## Architecture
Four FastMCP servers communicating via stdio, orchestrated by a central agent:
1. **rss-fetcher** — Fetches and parses Hugo RSS feeds and individual blog posts
2. **linkedin-poster** — Posts formatted content to LinkedIn personal profile
3. **x-poster** — Posts formatted tweets to X (Twitter) via tweepy
4. **devto-poster** — Publishes full markdown articles to Dev.to organization via Forem API
5. **record-keeper** — Tracks published posts in JSON, prevents duplicates
6. **gsc-fetcher** — Reads Google Search Console page performance (clicks/impressions/CTR/position) for the GSC-based selection strategy

## Platform Registry
Platforms registered in `registry/platforms_registry.json`:
- **aspose** — https://blog.aspose.com
- **groupdocs** — https://blog.groupdocs.com
- **conholdate** — https://blog.conholdate.com

Adding a new platform = new JSON entry only, no code change.

## Decision Log
| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D-001 | FastMCP with stdio transport | CLI tool, subprocess communication is simplest |
| D-002 | OpenAI Python SDK for LLM | Company's GPT-OSS is OpenAI-compatible |
| D-003 | Pydantic BaseSettings + .env | Matches existing agent patterns, type-safe config |
| D-004 | Pre-generated LinkedIn token | Simplest auth approach for CLI tool |
| D-005 | JSON file storage | Simple, no DB dependency, future web UI can read same files |
| D-006 | tweepy for X API | OAuth 1.0a signing required for X API v2 posting |
| D-007 | Independent platform failures | LinkedIn failure doesn't block X and vice versa |
| D-008 | Dev.to publishes full articles | Dev.to is a content platform — LLM generates a 400-600 word markdown article (not a social snippet), with canonical_url pointing to the original blog for SEO |
| D-009 | devto_org_id per platform in registry | Each blog platform can map to its own Dev.to org; null means Dev.to skipped for that platform |
| D-010 | LinkedIn posts carry an article card | Clickable link-preview card (title + description + thumbnail) drives more blog clicks than a raw URL line and guarantees the link is always visible. LinkedIn doesn't scrape URLs, so the thumbnail is uploaded via the Images API; og:image is HEAD-verified with fallback to the first in-article image (some Hugo themes emit broken og:image). The raw URL line is stripped from LinkedIn commentary since the card carries the (UTM-tagged) link |
| D-011 | Facebook posts are photo posts when an image is available | The blogs' broken og:image means Facebook's link-card scraper finds no image, so link posts render without one. Photo posts (/photos with url+caption) show the verified featured image; the UTM blog URL stays in the caption as a clickable link. Falls back to a link post when no image is found. Proper long-term fix is repairing og:image in the Hugo theme (helps all platforms) |
| D-012 | Dev.to articles carry main_image + clean canonical_url | Cover image (same verified featured image) shows in the Dev.to feed. Bug fix: canonical_url was accepted but never sent in the payload — all pre-2026-07-10 articles lack it (backfill possible via PUT /articles/{id}). Canonical uses the clean blog URL, never the UTM-tagged one, so search engines index the true article location; the teaser CTA link keeps UTM for analytics |
| D-013 | Shorter social post targets: LinkedIn 60-100 words, Facebook 30-60 words | Since D-010/D-011 the article card/photo already carries title+image, so long commentary duplicated it. LinkedIn folds text after ~210 chars, Facebook after ~125 — hook must be front-loaded, and prompts now forbid restating the title. Validation floors in llm_service.py lowered to match (LinkedIn 40, Facebook 20; old 80-word floor would have rejected every valid Facebook post). Dev.to (400-600 words) and X unchanged |
| D-014 | GSC Fetcher queries page-level stats via direct REST + google-auth (no google-api-python-client) | RSS only exposes ~10-20 latest posts, but a GSC-driven "pick underperforming content" strategy needs the site's entire indexed history, so RSS is bypassed entirely for this strategy — `fetch_post_by_url` (already used by Manual Mode) fetches content for whichever URL GSC surfaces, regardless of age. Querying with `dimensions: ["page"]` gets GSC's own per-page aggregation for free, avoiding manual query-level rollups. Reused the existing `sheet-reader` service account (already granted GSC property access) rather than provisioning a new one. Filtering (position/impressions/recency) and ranking are intentionally left to the orchestrator, not this server — mirrors the rss-fetcher/orchestrator split |
| D-015 | GSC selection strategy excludes locale-prefixed paths (`/it/`, `/zh-tw/`, `/fa/`, etc.) | Live-testing surfaced an Italian-language post as the top GSC candidate — the blog indexes translated copies of posts under locale-prefixed paths, and GSC ranks them alongside the English original. The LLM correctly formatted the post in Italian, which is wrong for an English-audience LinkedIn/Facebook page. Fixed with a regex filter (`^[a-z]{2}(-[a-z]{2})?$` on the first path segment) validated against real `blog.aspose.cloud` data (~20 locale prefixes match, category paths like `pdf`/`cells`/`3d` don't) |

## Last Updated
2026-07-23 — Stage 10 complete: GSC selection strategy wired into the orchestrator (D-014, D-015). `--strategy gsc` on `--auto` ranks GSC pages by impressions/CTR/position, filters out already-published/too-new/non-English-locale pages, and feeds the same downstream pipeline as `--strategy latest` (which was regression-tested unchanged after the refactor). Live-tested end-to-end against blog.aspose.cloud, including catching and fixing the locale-path issue (D-015) mid-test.
Adds new dependency `python-dateutil` (already present locally; not yet added to the CI workflows' pip install line — needed before `--strategy gsc` can run in GitHub Actions).
Not yet built: workflow schedule change (2nd weekly run per active brand uses GSC strategy instead of latest) — everything currently must be triggered manually with `--strategy gsc`.

2026-07-23 (later still) — Stage 11 complete: blogcaster.yml and blogcaster-groupdocs-cloud.yml each split their single schedule cron into two entries (aspose-cloud: Mon=latest/Fri=gsc; groupdocs-cloud: Tue=latest/Thu=gsc), with a new "Resolve strategy" step that reads github.event.schedule to pick the strategy for scheduled runs, or a new `strategy` workflow_dispatch input for manual runs (default latest). Bash conditional logic simulated locally for all four trigger scenarios (both scheduled crons, manual dispatch with/without explicit strategy) — all resolved correctly. Not yet observed on an actual GitHub Actions trigger since the next real Friday/Thursday GSC-scheduled run hasn't happened yet.
2026-07-23 (later) — INCIDENT: the scheduled groupdocs-cloud workflow failed in production (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dateutil'`) because the Stage 10 commit added a top-level `from dateutil import parser` in orchestrator.py without adding `python-dateutil` to the CI pip install line. Worse: since `open_mcp_sessions` always starts the gsc-fetcher subprocess regardless of strategy, and that server imports `google-auth` at module level, EVERY scheduled run (not just --strategy gsc ones) was broken, not just groupdocs-cloud's. Fixed by adding `google-auth python-dateutil` to the pip install line in both blogcaster.yml and blogcaster-groupdocs-cloud.yml. Verified by reproducing the exact failure in an isolated venv matching the old CI install line, then confirming both orchestrator.py and gsc-fetcher/server.py import cleanly with the fix. Not yet committed/pushed.
2026-07-16 — Shorter post lengths (D-013): LinkedIn 60-100 words, Facebook 30-60 words; prompts rewritten to front-load the hook and not restate the title; llm_service.py validation floors lowered (LinkedIn 40, Facebook 20). Dry-run verified on aspose for both platforms. NOT committed or pushed.
2026-07-10 — LinkedIn article cards (D-010), Facebook photo posts (D-011), and Dev.to cover image + canonical fix (D-012) all live-tested OK. --no-metrics CLI flag added. All changes local only — NOT committed or pushed.
X posting is ON HOLD: X API now demands paid credits, so X posts stopped (explains missing X entries in recent records). No X work planned until that changes.
Open items: (1) optional per-platform default banner for imageless posts; (2) backfill canonical_url on ~40 old Dev.to articles
