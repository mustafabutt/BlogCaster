# PROJECT CONTEXT — Social Media Agent

## Overview
A CLI-based agent that fetches blog posts from Hugo-based blog platforms via RSS feeds, formats them into professional social media posts using an LLM, and publishes them to LinkedIn and X (Twitter). The agent is platform-driven — each blog platform is registered in a JSON registry and the agent can operate independently per platform.

## Two Operating Modes
- **Manual Mode**: User provides a specific blog post URL. Agent auto-detects the platform, fetches content, formats, posts, and records.
- **Auto Mode**: User provides a platform ID. Agent fetches the RSS feed, picks the latest unpublished post, formats, posts, and records.

## Tech Stack
| Component | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | Python |
| MCP Framework | FastMCP (stdio transport) |
| LLM | Self-hosted GPT-OSS via OpenAI Python SDK (AsyncOpenAI) |
| LinkedIn API | LinkedIn Personal Profile API (OAuth 2.0 pre-generated token) |
| X (Twitter) API | X API v2 via tweepy (OAuth 1.0a) |
| Dev.to API | Forem REST API v1 (API key auth) |
| Config | Pydantic BaseSettings + .env file |
| Data Source | Hugo RSS feeds |
| State Storage | JSON files (published_record.json) |
| Logging | Python logging → logs/logs.txt |

## Key Environment Variables

## Architecture
Four FastMCP servers communicating via stdio, orchestrated by a central agent:
1. **rss-fetcher** — Fetches and parses Hugo RSS feeds and individual blog posts
2. **linkedin-poster** — Posts formatted content to LinkedIn personal profile
3. **x-poster** — Posts formatted tweets to X (Twitter) via tweepy
4. **devto-poster** — Publishes full markdown articles to Dev.to organization via Forem API
5. **record-keeper** — Tracks published posts in JSON, prevents duplicates

## Platform Registry
Platforms registered in `registry/platforms_registry.json`:
- **aspose** — https://blog.aspose.com
- **groupdocs** — https://blog.groupdocs.com
- **conholdate** — https://blog.conholdate.com

Adding a new platform = new JSON entry only, no code change.

## Decision Log
| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D-001 | FastMCP with stdio transport | CLI tool, subprocess communication is simplest |
| D-002 | OpenAI Python SDK for LLM | Company's GPT-OSS is OpenAI-compatible |
| D-003 | Pydantic BaseSettings + .env | Matches existing agent patterns, type-safe config |
| D-004 | Pre-generated LinkedIn token | Simplest auth approach for CLI tool |
| D-005 | JSON file storage | Simple, no DB dependency, future web UI can read same files |
| D-006 | tweepy for X API | OAuth 1.0a signing required for X API v2 posting |
| D-007 | Independent platform failures | LinkedIn failure doesn't block X and vice versa |
| D-008 | Dev.to publishes full articles | Dev.to is a content platform — LLM generates a 400-600 word markdown article (not a social snippet), with canonical_url pointing to the original blog for SEO |
| D-009 | devto_org_id per platform in registry | Each blog platform can map to its own Dev.to org; null means Dev.to skipped for that platform |
| D-010 | LinkedIn posts carry an article card | Clickable link-preview card (title + description + thumbnail) drives more blog clicks than a raw URL line and guarantees the link is always visible. LinkedIn doesn't scrape URLs, so the thumbnail is uploaded via the Images API; og:image is HEAD-verified with fallback to the first in-article image (some Hugo themes emit broken og:image). The raw URL line is stripped from LinkedIn commentary since the card carries the (UTM-tagged) link |
| D-011 | Facebook posts are photo posts when an image is available | The blogs' broken og:image means Facebook's link-card scraper finds no image, so link posts render without one. Photo posts (/photos with url+caption) show the verified featured image; the UTM blog URL stays in the caption as a clickable link. Falls back to a link post when no image is found. Proper long-term fix is repairing og:image in the Hugo theme (helps all platforms) |
| D-012 | Dev.to articles carry main_image + clean canonical_url | Cover image (same verified featured image) shows in the Dev.to feed. Bug fix: canonical_url was accepted but never sent in the payload — all pre-2026-07-10 articles lack it (backfill possible via PUT /articles/{id}). Canonical uses the clean blog URL, never the UTM-tagged one, so search engines index the true article location; the teaser CTA link keeps UTM for analytics |
| D-013 | Shorter social post targets: LinkedIn 60-100 words, Facebook 30-60 words | Since D-010/D-011 the article card/photo already carries title+image, so long commentary duplicated it. LinkedIn folds text after ~210 chars, Facebook after ~125 — hook must be front-loaded, and prompts now forbid restating the title. Validation floors in llm_service.py lowered to match (LinkedIn 40, Facebook 20; old 80-word floor would have rejected every valid Facebook post). Dev.to (400-600 words) and X unchanged |

## Last Updated
2026-07-16 — Shorter post lengths (D-013): LinkedIn 60-100 words, Facebook 30-60 words; prompts rewritten to front-load the hook and not restate the title; llm_service.py validation floors lowered (LinkedIn 40, Facebook 20). Dry-run verified on aspose for both platforms. NOT committed or pushed.
2026-07-10 — LinkedIn article cards (D-010), Facebook photo posts (D-011), and Dev.to cover image + canonical fix (D-012) all live-tested OK. --no-metrics CLI flag added. All changes local only — NOT committed or pushed.
X posting is ON HOLD: X API now demands paid credits, so X posts stopped (explains missing X entries in recent records). No X work planned until that changes.
Open items: (1) optional per-platform default banner for imageless posts; (2) backfill canonical_url on ~40 old Dev.to articles
